            To develop a working poker strategy, it's crucial to understand the interaction between players, the odds, and the advantages of table position.

                Position Strategy
                <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                    Almost all authors agree that where a player sits in the order of play (known as position) is an important element of Texas hold 'em strategy. Players who act later have more information than players who act earlier. As a result, players typically play fewer hands from early positions than later positions.

                    The dealer is always the strongest player at the table because he is on the button and has the ability to bet last. The player who bets last has the most information, and therefore can make the most educated decision about how to continue in the course of the game play. The person to the right of the dealer, sometimes known as the "cutoff", potentially has more power than the dealer, because he could raise the bet and knock the dealer out of play, therefore positioning himself as the strongest player on the board. Players who are in early positions are considered the weakest because they have the least amount of information about the table, so they cannot make as much of an educated decision as the dealer.

                Starting Hand
                <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                    There are 169 different two card starting hand combinations in hold’em poker. This number assumes, for the sake of argument, that <span style="color: black">A&spades; K&spades;</span> is the same as <span style="color: green">A&clubs; K&clubs;</span>, or any other suited combination. If you are not dealt a pair, then your starting hand will either be suited or unsuited, and either connected or unconnected (gapped). This means your starting hand will fall into one of the following five categories:

                <h4 style="color: #962323; margin-top: 30px;">The Best Starting Hands in Hold’em</h4>
                <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                    <b>Group 1 (AA, KK):</b> These two starting hands are the major players in hold’em. It’s not often you’ll get dealt Aces or Kings. In fact you get either Aces or Kings once in every 110 hands, so it’s not nearly as often as we’d like. Aces are by far the best possible starting hand in hold’em, closely followed by Kings. However, you should be aware that even Aces or Kings can get cracked, and they don’t play too well against multiple opponents. This means you should definitely be raising pre-flop to narrow the field. Extra caution is necessary when playing Kings, because if an Ace falls on the flop then you’re losing to anyone who has a single Ace in their starting hand. While they are very strong hands which most players love to get, they are certainly not unbeatable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Group 2 (QQ, JJ, AKs):</b> Queens and Jacks are great starting hands, and with either of these, you can usually be confident you have the best starting hand. Of course they are dominated by Aces and Kings, but they’re a favourite against all other starting hands. While Queens and Jacks will occasionally run into a player holding either Aces or Kings, it doesn’t happen too often. Play these cards strongly, and always look to raise with them. Ace-King is known throughout the poker world as Big Slick, and when suited it’s often called Super Slick. While it isn’t a ‘made hand’, unlike a pair, it offers great potential. It’s only a big underdog to Aces and Kings, and even pairs like Queens and Jacks are only slight favourites. The beauty of AK (suited or unsuited), is that it dominates so many other hands like AQ, AJ, AT, and so on. These types of hands are the ones that players usually end up pushing all-in with late in a tournament.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Group 3 (TT, AK, AQs, AJs, KQs):</b> This next group of starting hands is also a strong bunch. You should definitely be looking to raise pre-flop with any of these hands too. We’ve already talked about the power of AK, but starting hands like AQs, and AJs, are also very strong and often run into weaker Ace-X combinations. Even though these are all strong starting hands, and most of the time you’ll be winning pre-flop, you have to be careful – particularly a hand like KQs, which you can easily fold to a re-raise.
                </p>
                <h4 style="color: #962323; margin-top: 50px;">Tips for Starting Hands Selections</h4>
                <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                    <b>Suited Cards:</b> You’ll often hear novice players responding to questioning of why they played a particular starting hand with the line “well, because they were suited”. Some suited cards are worth playing and it’s certainly better to start with suited cards than unsuited cards. However, the odds of flopping a flush is 1 out of 118 hands (0.8%) with two suited cards, and you’ll only make a flush after the river around 6.5% of the time. Don’t fall into the trap of playing any two cards just because they happen to be suited – it doesn’t make a big enough difference to make junk hands valuable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Kicker Issues:</b> The word ‘kicker’ means the smaller of your two cards. Some players play a hand if it contains an Ace with any other card (such as an Ace with a 3 kicker), and this type of play ultimately cost players money and tournaments. For example, let’s suppose a player calls with A6 and the flop comes A83. What does the player do? bet? call? raise? call a big raise? go all-in? What if the flop comes Q63? The player has middle pair – which is very hard to play. Hey, the flop could come A6X – the player has two pair, Aces and sixes but this happens only 1 out of 49 hands (2%). Until you learn when and how to play Ace junk (AX) go slow with it. One good thing about A junk and K junk, is that you do not need to play these hands to learn when they may be profitable. Let experience from other hands and study be your teacher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Position:</b> Your position on the poker table will be a major factor in deciding which starting hands you should play. The later your position in the betting order, the better – because you get to decide what to do after most of your opponents have acted. We’ll talk much more about the importance of position throughout our lessons on Pokerology, but as a first step please see our lesson on the value of position. Playing position can elude us at first because it is a part of poker that lends itself to be exploited through experience. However, you must quickly realize that your position at the table should heavily influence the choice of starting hands that you play. Until a player has a feel or grasp for positional play, just believe and follow some of the suggestions on the subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>A Raised Pot:</b> Whether or not a pot has been raised should be a very important factor in your decision to play a particular starting hand. Your selection of starting hands should change when the pot has been raised by a reasonable player. If there has been a raise and a re-raise before you’re due to act, then you should only consider playing with a very strong hand. Of course this will also depend on the personality types of the other players and whether the game is very loose or passive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don’t fall into the trap of playing any two cards. Most poker players want to play hands and as a beginner it’s very easy to be seduced by suited cards or picture cards, or any two-card holding that contains an Ace of a King – but if you play hold’em correctly, you’re going to be selective and toss away the vast majority of hands you’re dealt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you gain more poker playing experience you can begin to open up your range of starting hands – but until then, proceed with caution and only play the best hands. Loose, promiscuous play will get you into trouble and is the downfall of many players.
