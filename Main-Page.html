                What is Texas Hold'em Poker?
                <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                    Texas Hold'em is the world's most popular variant of poker game played in 
                    both live casinos and online. Popularity of the game surged in the 2000s 
                    due to exposures on TV, Internet, and in popular literatures. The 
                    simplicity of the game's rules, hand-ranking, and intense gameplays 
                    made it the most popular and well-known poker game around the
                    world. The history background of Texas Hold'em can be found <a href="PokerHistory.html">here</a>.

                    The Rules of Texas Hold'em Poker
                <h5 style="color: #962323; margin-top:10px;">Table Positions</h5>
                <p>
                    The game uses a standard deck of 52 cards (without joker cards) and is often played 
                    on a table with 2 to 10 players. An illustration of the position names on a standard 
                    nine-handed table is shown below. The abbreviations stands for: Under The Guns (UTG, UTG+1, UTG+2), 
                    Middle Positions (Low Jack, High Jack), Cut Off (CO), Button (BTN), Small Blind (SB), Big Blind (BB).
                </p>
                <img id="image1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="poker-position.jpg">
                <p>
                    Before each game starts, players at the SB and BB positons are forced to post certain amount of chips
                    to initiate the betting. The amount the "blinds" can vary depending on the table stakes. Typically,
                    the small blind is half the size of the big blind (e.g. in a $1/$2 Holdâ€™em game the small blind is $1 
                    and the big blind is $2). After each game finishes, all positions rotate clock-wise on the table so that 
                    each player gets to play on every positions. 
                </p>
                <h5 style="color: #962323; margin-top: 30px;">Game Play</h5>
                <p>   
                    The goal of a Texas Hold'em game is to use the two cards in your hand in combination with the community 
                    cards to make the best possible five-card poker hand (compared on a <a href="#ranks">Hand-Ranking system</a>), and to earn as many chips as possible from your 
                    oppnents. The game is consisted of five stages:
                </p>
                <ul id="stages">
                    <li>Preflop</li>
                    <li>Flop</li>
                    <li>Turn</li>
                    <li>River</li>
                    <li>Showdown</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Preflop:</b> during the preflop stage, each player is dealt with two private cards that 
                    can only be revealed by themselves. Next, players make actions one by one in a 
                    clock-wise order--starting from the UTG position all the way to the BB. Players can 
                    either <b>call</b> (bet chips equal to the previous player's bet; in this stage, the first player who calls
                    needs a bet size equal to the big blind), <b>fold</b> (discard a hand and give up the current pot), <b>raise</b> (bet chips 
                    more than the big blind after all previous players are either called or folded), or <b>re-raise</b> (bet a even larger 
                    size compared to a previous raise). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: If a player raises the bet, each player must now call the new amount to continue playing the current hand, 
                    including those who may have already acted. If a player chooses to fold, the money already in the "Pot" from the 
                    prior "call" remains in the pot. If no player raises the big blind, then the player in BB position may check or raise.
                    The round of betting stops when all players have either folded or called the last raise.
                </p>
                <img id="image2" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="stages.png">
                <p>
                    <b>Flop:</b> three cards are being dealt to the middle of the table (facing up). They are called the community 
                    cards as they can be seen by everyone on the table. Then a new betting round starts, from the SB position clock-wise to the 
                    BTN. In addition to call, fold, raise and re-raise, Players now have the options to <b>check</b> (without betting anything) 
                    and <b>bet</b> (any desired size larger than the big blind). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A player may check or bet only if the player is the first to act or all previous players have checked; if a previous player 
                    has bet, raise, or re-raised, the player may only choose to call, fold, or re-raise. the betting round ends when all players have 
                    folded or called the last bet or raise, or if all players have "checked".
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Turn:</b> One more community card is dealt to the table centre, followed by another betting round (same as the Flop).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>River:</b> The last community card is dealt to the table centre, followed by the final round of betting (same as the Flop).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any of the previous stages (Preflop, Flop, Turn, River), if there is only one player remaining on the table (all other 
                    players are folded), the player wins the round and takes all the pot (all chips remain on the table) and no later stages will 
                    be proceeded; if more than one player remains after the last betting round, the next Showdown stage is proceeded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Showdown:</b> All players remaining on the table expose and compare their hands to determine the winner. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Each player has seven cards (the two private cards + the five community cards), and whichever five cards that make the best hand on the 
                    <a href="#ranks">Hand-Ranking system</a> becomes the player's hand. All remaining players' hands are compared and the hand with the highest rank on the 
                    <a href="#ranks">Hand-Ranking system</a> wins the game.
